# board-scrape

Data scraped about local ski resorts

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/25997a41-3571-483b-b32e-e17b00fbf8ae/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/board-scrape/deploys)

You must run `netlify build` the first time you try building

You can test the function at `http://localhost:34567/.netlify/functions/scrape-resort`

The project is being put on hold since it appears you cannot easily get puppeteer working on netlify functions
